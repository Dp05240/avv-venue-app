# 🔧 Railway Deployment Fix

## ❌ Problem
Railway failed because it couldn't determine which directory to build from the root.

## ✅ Solution
I've updated the configuration to specify the frontend directory.

## 🚀 Updated Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push Updated Code
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment configuration"
git push
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Railway
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click "Deploy" again
3. Railway will now use the `frontend/` directory

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Add these in Railway:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 📁 Current Structure
```
avv-venue-app/
├── frontend/          ← Railway will build this
├── backend/           ← Deploy separately later
├── railway.json       ← Updated config
├── railway.toml       ← Updated config
└── package.json       ← Updated scripts
```

## 🎯 What Changed
- ✅ Added `sourceDir: "frontend"` to railway.json
- ✅ Updated root package.json scripts
- ✅ Created railway.toml configuration
- ✅ Railway now knows to build from frontend/

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. Push the updated code
2. Redeploy on Railway
3. Your frontend will be live!
4. Backend can be deployed separately later

**The deployment should work now!** 🚀
